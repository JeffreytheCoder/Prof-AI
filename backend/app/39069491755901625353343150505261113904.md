# Introduction to Linear Regression

- **Linear regression** is a method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the variables and tries to find the line of best fit that minimizes the sum of squared errors.

## Simple Linear Regression

- Simple linear regression involves modeling the relationship between a dependent variable `y` and a single independent variable `x`.
- The line of best fit can be represented by the equation `y = b0 + b1*x`, where `b0` is the y-intercept and `b1` is the slope of the line.

## Multiple Linear Regression

- Multiple linear regression involves modeling the relationship between a dependent variable `y` and multiple independent variables `x1, x2, ..., xn`.
- The line of best fit can be represented by the equation `y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bn*xn`.

## Implementing Linear Regression in Python

- We can use the `LinearRegression` class from the `scikit-learn` library to perform linear regression in Python.
- Here is an example of how to fit a simple linear regression model:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# define the data
X = [[0], [1], [2]]
y = [0, 1, 2]

# create and fit the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, y)

# make predictions
predictions = model.predict([[3], [4]])
```

## Visualizing Results
- We can use visualization libraries such as matplotlib or seaborn to create scatter plots and visualize the line of best fit.
- Here is an example of how to create a scatter plot with a fitted line:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# define the data
X = [0, 1, 2]
y = [0, 1, 2]

# plot the data
plt.scatter(X, y)

# plot the fitted line
plt.plot(X, y)

# show the plot
plt.show()
Is there anything else you would like to know?
